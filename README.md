# Sign to Voice Language Converter 🤟

A real-time system that translates sign language gestures into spoken words, bridging the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the hearing world.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize hand signs and convert them into audible speech using a trained model. It aims to assist individuals with speech disabilities in communicating more effectively in real-world situations.

## 🔧 Features

- 📷 Real-time sign language detection using webcam input
- 🧠 Trained model for recognizing specific signs
- 🔊 Converts detected signs into voice output
- 🖥️ User-friendly graphical interface (optional)
- 🌐 Designed for accessibility and ease of use

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **OpenCV** – For image capture and processing
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – For building and training the sign detection model
- **Pyttsx3 / gTTS** – For text-to-speech conversion
- **Tkinter / Streamlit** – (Optional) GUI for easier interaction
